## Contributing

Please file an issue for discussion before sending a PR for a new adder. Most new adders will likely be recommended to be implemented as community adders. This repository will only hold a very limited number of adders at the maintainers discretion that address widely held needs, are considered best-in-class, and are widely used in the Svelte community.

## Supporting Svelte

Svelte is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by fantastic volunteers. If you'd like to support their efforts, please consider:
