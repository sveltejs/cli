## Contributing

Please file an issue for discussion before sending a PR for a new add-on. Most new add-ons will likely be recommended to be implemented as community add-ons. This repository will only hold a very limited number of add-ons at the maintainers discretion that address widely held needs, are considered best-in-class, and are widely used in the Svelte community.
