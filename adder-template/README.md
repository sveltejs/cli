The adder template for community adders for [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Cloning the template

Use [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to clone the template:

```shell
npx degit sveltejs/cli/adder-template adder-name
```

## Using the adder

To run the adder, we'll first need a project to apply it to.

Create the project with the following script:

```shell
npm run create-temp
```

This will create a SvelteKit project in the `temp` directory.

To execute the adder, run:

```shell
npm start
```

## Sharing your adder

When you're ready to publish your adder to NPM, run:

```shell
npm publish
```

Your published adder can now be used by anyone!

To execute the newly published package with `sv`, run:

```shell
npx sv add --community npm:adder-package-name
```

After that, feel free to open a pull request to [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli) and add your adder to the [community list](/community/).

## Things to be aware of

Community adders are **not permitted** to have any external dependencies outside of `@svelte-cli/core`. If the use of a dependency is absolutely necessary, then they can be bundled using a bundler of your choosing (e.g. Rollup, Rolldown, tsup, etc.).
