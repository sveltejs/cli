## Community adder template

We have a [community adder template](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/tree/main/community-adder-template) that lives inside our GitHub monorepo. This should be a starting point for all new community adders.

We do not provide any TS template, as the types provided by all the helper methods we expose should be enough to fulfill your needs! If you still want to use TypeScript, that's totally fine as well.

## Basic usage

We have 5 common files: `index.js`, `config/adder.js`, `config/options.js`, `config/check.js`, `config/test.js`. Please check official adders for examples and do not be shy about asking questions in the GitHub issues or on Discord.
