## community adder template

We have a [community adder template](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/tree/main/community-adder-template) that lives inside our GitHub monorepo. This should be a starting point for all new community adders.

We do not provide any TS template, as the types provided by all the helper methods we expose should be enough to fullfill your needs! If you still want to use typescript, nobody will prevent you.

## basic usage

add example usage for our 5 common files (index.js, config/adder.js, config/options.js, config/check.js, config/test.js) and explain what they are. Ommitted at this point, since the code templates do not work

Do we need to explain more? I think most of the things should be pretty self explanatory and can be added on demand
