## requirements

- must benefit the overall svelte ecosystem and the community
- must not be too specific to one presons needs
- todo: whatever else we can think of

## process

- modify file `todo` to add your community adder
- create a PR
- once merged, it might take a while before we draft a new release of `sv`, only then your new community adder will be available
