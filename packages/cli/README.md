## Acknowledgements

Thank you to [Christopher Brown](https://github.com/chbrown) who originally owned the `sv` name on npm for graciously allowing it to be used for this package. You can find the original `sv` package at [`@chbrown/sv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chbrown/sv).

This project was formed by merging the `create-svelte` and `svelte-add` CLIs. Thank you to [J](https://github.com/babichjacob) for starting the community-led `svelte-add` project and to the [`svelte-add` contributors](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add/graphs/contributors).
